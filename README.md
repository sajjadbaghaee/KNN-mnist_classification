# 📘 MNIST Digit Classification Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and PCA  
### *A Comprehensive Machine Learning Workflow with Dimensionality Reduction*

This repository contains a fully documented Jupyter Notebook demonstrating **handwritten digit classification** on the **MNIST dataset** using the **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm, enhanced with **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction. The notebook provides a structured, pedagogical pipeline aligned with academic machine learning methodology.

## 🔍 1. Overview

The MNIST dataset consists of **70,000 grayscale images**, each representing a handwritten digit (0–9). Each image is 28×28 pixels, flattened into a 784-dimensional vector. KNN is a simple, non-parametric classifier, but its performance is heavily influenced by high dimensionality and computational cost.

This notebook demonstrates:

- Exploratory data analysis and visualization  
- Training a baseline KNN classifier  
- Evaluating model accuracy and misclassifications  
- Understanding the effect of high dimensionality  
- Applying PCA to compress MNIST into a more meaningful feature space  
- Comparing accuracy and performance with and without PCA  
- Visualizing PCA components (“eigen-digits”) and 2D projections  

The goal is to showcase both **KNN’s strengths** and **PCA’s importance** in handling large, high-dimensional datasets.

## 📊 3. Methods and Workflow

### **3.1 Data Loading & Preprocessing**
- MNIST dataset is loaded from OpenML using scikit-learn.  
- Pixel values are normalized to \[0,1\] for stable distance computation.  
- Subsets (20,000 train / 5,000 test) improve computational efficiency.  

### **3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Includes:
- Visualization of sample digits  
- Grid plots of random samples  
- Sanity checks of shapes and distributions  

---

### **3.3 Baseline KNN Classifier**
With `k = 3`, the notebook evaluates:

- Accuracy  
- Confusion matrix  
- Classification report  
- Prediction time  
- Examples of correct and incorrect classifications  

This forms a reference point for later comparison.

---

### **3.4 Hyperparameter Sensitivity**
Performance is evaluated for odd values of `k` from 1 to 11:

- Training accuracy  
- Test accuracy  
- Runtime characteristics  

Revealing KNN’s natural **bias–variance trade-off**.

---

### **3.5 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
PCA is used to address:

- Curse of dimensionality  
- Noisy and redundant pixel features  
- Slow KNN computation in 784-D space  

The notebook includes:

- Explained variance curves  
- Automatic PCA component selection (95% variance)  
- Visualization of PCA components (eigen-digits)  
- PCA 2D projection of MNIST clusters  

---

### **3.6 PCA + KNN Pipeline**
The notebook compares multiple models:

| Model          | Accuracy | Fit Time | Prediction Time |
|----------------|----------|----------|------------------|
| No PCA         | High     | Slow     | Very Slow        |
| PCA-20         | Medium   | Fast     | Very Fast        |
| PCA-50         | High     | Fast     | Fast             |
| PCA-100        | High     | Moderate | Moderate         |

Results demonstrate that **50 PCA components** deliver an excellent trade-off between accuracy and speed.

## 🧠 4. Key Insights

- PCA significantly improves KNN performance by reducing noise and dimensionality.  
- PCA speeds up prediction dramatically (10–15× faster).  
- Many MNIST pixels are redundant, and meaningful information lies in a lower-dimensional manifold.  
- PCA components visualize key features such as strokes, curves, and digit structure.
